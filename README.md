# Project Summary
This is the code used to run the Django web application for my Python script I used for as a learning management system managing grade entry and notification using GitHub Classroom, Google Sheets, and Slack. I wanted to use Django to build a more user-friendly experience for professors and students who were not comfortable running a Python script locally on their laptops.
